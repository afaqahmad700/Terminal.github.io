         <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>
         <p>In Naran, the climate is cold in winters and mild cool in summers. There is significant rainfall in summers and heavy snowfall in winters. Even the driest month still has a lot of rainfall. The average annual temperature in Naran is 10.1 Â°C. The region is Alpine in geography and climate, with forests and meadows dominating the landscape below peaks that reach over 17,000 feet. Following is the weather history of Naran </p>
